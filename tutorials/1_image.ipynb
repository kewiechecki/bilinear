We also explored bilinear layers and interaction matrices, a central object toward interpreting them. This chapter will cover small image classifiers trained on MNIST. Our interpretable, bilinear architecture will give us the tools necessary to understand what these models are learning. Previously, this was famously difficult; the Anthropic team once made the following statement [[ref](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/jan-update#mnist-sparse)].\n",

This is especially nice since we can order eigenvectors by relevance and analyze however many we wish, knowing we are doing so optimally.\n",

Negative eigenvectors are somewhat less intuitive; they generally represent specific parts that are most destructive towards classifying a given digit, which is often hard to understand.

We satisfy the second criterion by considering features per digit, which are generally easier to understand. However, it may miss shared features, specific strokes that occur in multiple digits, which the model leverages. In that sense, our decomposition could be shorter. This becomes especially important when scaling up (as the growth is exponential). It's currently somewhat unclear what the best way is to achieve both criteria. One possibility is dictionary learning, not SAEs, but 'Ye Olde' Lasso Regression.\n",

At each step, we compute eigenvectors and use those as output directions for the next layers. One could perform a sort of beam search to extract the most important global directions. However, this leverages no shared features in the model, which is suboptimal. Clustering could possibly help in this."
